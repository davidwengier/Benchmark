# Pragmatic Performance

A brief discussion of performance optimization and when to do it, of how to benchmark and use BenchmarkDotNet, and some common gotchas in the .NET framework that you may or may not be aware of.

The talk has also been presented at various user groups and at NDC Oslo 2019.

Note: This is a general dumping ground for a bunch of my benchmarks (or a bench of my bunchmarks), not just the source code for the benchmarks presented in the slides or video.
